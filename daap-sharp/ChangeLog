2006-09-26  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/ContentFetcher.cs: set ServicePoint connection limit to 3.
	We effectively waste one by having the '/update' request, so it's
	easy to run out.

2006-09-26  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/User.cs: added, represents a user connected to the server
	* src/Server.cs: add user login/logout events as well as a Users
	property for obtaining the list of logged-in users.

2006-09-24  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Client.cs: kill all connections to the server before logging out.

2006-09-18  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	iTunes only passes the HTTP password there, and assumes the
	session id is good enough after that.

2006-08-06  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Server.cs: when opening tracks for streaming, use FileAccess.Read
	* src/ContentCodeBag.cs: don't specify the 'content-code' embedded
	resource specifically since when building on Windows it gets assigned
	a totally outrageous name.

2006-07-13  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	* src/Mono.Zeroconf/*: Updated (again)

2006-03-07  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

2006-03-05  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	* src/Mono.Zeroconf/*: Updated Mono.Zeroconf sources

2006-02-22  James Willcox  <snorp@snorp.net>

	sources	(fix VPN-related DNS resolve bug)

2006-01-20  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@abock.org>

	bug; Added --enable-mdnsd to skip Avahi check and define ENABLE_MDNSD
	for compilation 

	* src/Makefile.am: Added files to DISTCLEANFILES so 'make distcheck' 
	works; build with -debug and link using arguments from 
	MCS_FLAGS (AVAHI_LIBS) instead of -pkg; compile Mono.Zeroconf 
	sources into assembly use daap_SCRIPTS instead of daap_DATA to 
	get a 0755 chmod; install daap-sharp.dll.{mdb,config}

	* src/Server.cs:
	* src/ServiceLocator.cs: Only compile Avahi-related code if ENABLE_MDNSD
	is not defined, otherwise, compile the alternate Mono.Zeroconf code; 
	these changes allow DAAP support to be compatible with Avahi and
	Apple's mDNSResponder Zerconf implementation; daap-sharp should now
	be easily portable to OS X and Windows

	for native mdns calls

	* sample/Makefile.am: Build tests with -debug
